# Lab_6
In This lab i used the raspiberry Pi v2 camera to create programs in python. 

The first part is just a basic function of the camera that will take a picture, then record a video and save both to a location on my Pi.

The second part is the code provided where the camera will take a picture when a button is pressed. I expanded on this by adding a second button that will record a video when pressed. 

The third is code if found online that i thought was intresting, it takes the camera and turns it into a surveillance cameria, based off its ip address. This allows it to be accessed from your computer of cell phone, and view the image streaming from your camera. I did not develop this code but thought it was intersting and very easy to get working, so i included it as part of my submission.
